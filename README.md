#### Prerequisites
* [An Azure AD app with Delegated Graph API Permission to **DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#delegated-permission-to-microsoft-graph)

> * Make sure to set the `Redirect URI` for Web as `https://localhost`.
> * Enable ‘Access tokens’ under Implicit grant and hybrid flows.
> * Toggle ‘Enable the following mobile & desktop flows’ to yes under allow public client flows. Make a note of the `Application (Client) ID` and `Directory (Tenant) ID`.

* In the script repository, add the `Application (Client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID` of the application you created earlier as comma-separated values into the `client.config` file.

#### Switches supported by the tool
Use the following switches (parameters) to modify the tool’s default behavior.

* **IncludeLocalRules** — Use this switch to include all locally created/default Windows firewall rules in the export. Use of this switch can result in a large count of included rules.
* **IncludedDisabledRules** — e this switch to include all enabled and disabled Windows firewall rules in the export. Use of this switch can result in a large count of included rules.

#### Required Permissions

* Users assigned the Intune roles for Endpoint Security Manager, Intune Service Admin, or Global Admin can migrate Windows Firewall rules to Endpoint security policies.

#### How to run the tool?
To run the tool:

* Sign in to the reference machine with local administrator privileges.
* Download the repo as a zip file and extract them to a location of your choice
* The zip file contains the script file `Export-FirewallRules.ps1` and the `client.config` file. Unblock the `Export-FirewallRules.ps1` and the `client.config` file if they are blocked by Windows
* Add the `Application (Client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID` of the application you created earlier as comma-separated values into the `client.config` file.
* Execute the `Export-FirewallRules.ps1` script on the machine with required switches.
